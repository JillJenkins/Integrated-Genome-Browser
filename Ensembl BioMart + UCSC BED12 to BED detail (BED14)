"""
This script will accept a UCSC Table Browser ensGene BED file and merge it with an Ensembl Biomart file generating a BED14/detail file. To receive the desired output below, the Biomart file must be in a specific user-defined format(see below). 

Navigate to the following URL: 
    http://useast.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/22277bc12da5624bbf2728be0832e026

Database = Ensembl Genes 95
Choose Dataset = specific to the organism

Filters: 
    Your first time on the site, it will default to some selections, unselect all filters. The filter parameter should read [None selected] to move on to adding Attributes. 

Attributes:
    for this script to work, the following Attributes must be selected in the specified order, and will be found under +GENE:
    
        Transript stable ID version
        Gene stable ID version
        Gene name
        Gene description
    
Results(top of left margin options)
    Ensure 'Export all results to' has been selected as 'File' and 'TSV'
    Hit 'Go'

A file with name mart_export.tsv has been added to your downloads directory.
Rename the file: G_species_MMM_YYYY.mart.tsv and move it into the same directory with the UCSC BED file.
