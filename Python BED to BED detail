This script will accept a UCSC Table Browser ensGene BED file 
and merge it with an Ensembl Biomart file generating a BED14/detail file. 
To receive the desired output below, the Biomart file must be in a specific user-defined format. 

================ FORMATTING THE BIOMART FILE OUTPUT ======================
Navigate to the following URL: 
    http://useast.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/22277bc12da5624bbf2728be0832e026

Database = Ensembl Genes 95
Choose Dataset = specific to the organism

Filters: 
    Your first time on the site, it will default to some selections, unselect all filters. 
    The filter parameter should read [None selected] to move on to adding Attributes. 

Attributes:
    for this script to work, the following Attributes must be selected in the specified 
    order, and will be found under +GENE:
    
        Transript stable ID version
        Gene stable ID version
        Gene name
        Gene description
        
============================================================================

Results(top of left margin options)
    Ensure 'Export all results to' has been selected as 'File' and 'TSV'
    Hit 'Go'

A file with name mart_export.tsv has been added to your downloads directory.
Rename the file: G_species_MMM_YYYY.mart.tsv and move it into the same directory with the UCSC BED file.
